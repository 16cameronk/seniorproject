							<p>I spent the past few days fixing up this blog, meeting with Jacob and seeking out help from mentors outside of school. I have been working with Keenan Williams, CEO of REZI.co. He has been giving me worksheets and drills for javascript. He gave me the idea to make games in javascript before pursuing them in unity, for the marketplace. 
                                
							<p> This helped focus my senior project and the games that I want to make. I will make a game in the web browser which will be compatible across platforms, computer or mobile. Next week I will work on that game and the following week I will work on another cross platform web game. I will then work the last three weeks on a my mobile application(s using prefabs as Jacob suggested. </p>
							<p> I have an idea of what I want to make and now that I am properly prepared I will be going to the art room to get my characters, backgrounds, and sprites done. </p>
